# Evaluation Matrix
- randomly sampled 20 instructional cooking tutorial videos from the Cook2 dataset2. 

## User-Initiated Responses
- For each video, we generated 10 different queries for each user-initiated event (9 user-initiated events, as detailed in Sec. 2.3). Each query is consisted of a natural language query (generated by a LLM) and a screenshot of cooking extracted from other tutorial videos. This yielded a total of 90 queries per video, ensuring broad coverage of potential user behaviors. 


### accuracy
- a. if the system maps the user query to an incorrect event; 
- b. given a correct event mapping, if the system provides a correct response.

### quality
- evaluators rated the quality of the systemâ€™s prompt on a 7-point Likert scale, with the lowest quality being 1 and the highest quality being 7.
- aspects: length, tone, and details.
