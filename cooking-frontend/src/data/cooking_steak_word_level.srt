1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:00,600
One

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,700
of the

3
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:00,967
things

4
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:01,201
people

5
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:01,468
wonder

6
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:01,668
about

7
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,002
a lot

8
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:02,802
is how

9
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:02,902
I

10
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:08,174
cook.

11
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:08,475
So

12
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:08,975
the menu

13
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,476
today,

14
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:09,743
it's

15
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:10,110
an easy

16
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,310
one.

17
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm

18
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:10,543
going

19
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:10,777
to go

20
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,544
with a

21
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:11,845
burger

22
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:11,911
and

23
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,447
fries.

24
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:14,748
Let's

25
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,015
get us

26
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:15,148
some

27
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:15,415
French

28
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:15,715
fries.

29
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:16,916
Yeah,

30
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:17,550
that's

31
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,752
awful.

32
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:19,786
well,

33
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,820
see,

34
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,154
So

35
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:21,421
that's

36
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:21,521
our

37
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:21,855
first

38
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,022
little

39
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,655
catastrophe

40
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:22,722
of

41
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,023
the day

42
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,223
right

43
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:23,456
here.

44
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:28,528
True.

45
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:28,795
Just

46
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,062
get them

47
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:29,262
all

48
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:29,429
out

49
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,363
over the tray.

50
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:30,530
So

51
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:30,830
I just

52
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:30,964
put

53
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:31,164
this

54
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:31,331
in the

55
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:31,698
toaster

56
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:31,898
oven

57
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,432
here.

58
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:32,665
We do

59
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:32,732
it

60
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:32,799
for,

61
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:32,999
like,

62
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:33,033
a

63
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,601
half hour,

64
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:34,834
so

65
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,135
we have to

66
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:35,335
plug

67
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:35,468
in the

68
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:35,802
stove

69
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,302
to the

70
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,204
stove,

71
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:38,438
the

72
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:38,671
George

73
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:38,972
Foreman

74
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,172
Grill,

75
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:39,339
because

76
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:39,506
this

77
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:39,672
takes

78
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:39,706
a

79
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:39,873
couple

80
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:39,939
of

81
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:40,173
minutes

82
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:40,206
to

83
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:40,440
warm

84
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,508
up.

85
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:41,941
The fries

86
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,008
are

87
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:42,409
cooking.

88
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:42,575
So

89
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:42,809
let's

90
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:43,176
see

91
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,110
now.

92
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,878
This is stupid

93
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,011
that

94
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:45,311
I do,

95
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:45,845
but

96
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,079
you have

97
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,179
to

98
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:46,379
sort

99
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:46,413
of

100
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:46,679
check

101
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:46,846
out.

102
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:47,714
All right.

103
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:47,881
So

104
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,148
let's

105
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:48,348
just

106
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:48,581
try

107
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:48,815
one

108
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,182
now.

109
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:49,349
Of

110
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:49,549
course.

111
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:49,616
You

112
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:49,716
know,

113
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:49,816
I'm

114
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,016
afraid

115
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,083
of

116
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:50,350
burning

117
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,251
myself.

118
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,118
You

119
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:52,485
see, I

120
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:52,619
hit

121
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:52,919
the top

122
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:52,952
of

123
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:53,286
the thing

124
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:53,686
that,

125
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:53,920
like

126
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,120
this,

127
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,387
probably

128
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:54,554
still

129
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:54,721
has a

130
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:54,854
little

131
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,055
ways

132
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,023
to go.

133
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,290
So

134
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:57,457
let's

135
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:57,724
make a

136
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,158
burger.

137
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:58,358
So

138
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:58,491
we'll

139
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:58,658
just

140
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:58,892
cook

141
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,059
this

142
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,192
for

143
00:00:59,192 --> 00:00:59,692
probably

144
00:00:59,692 --> 00:00:59,959
about

145
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,260
3

146
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,461
minutes.

147
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:01,795
And

148
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:01,961
this.

149
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:02,095
And

150
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,296
that's

151
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:03,496
where

152
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:03,563
it

153
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,464
goes.

154
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:04,597
It

155
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:04,864
cooks

156
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,098
both

157
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:05,398
sides

158
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:05,432
at

159
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,199
once.

160
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:06,566
It's

161
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,100
really

162
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,367
easy

163
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,034
to use

164
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:08,568
because

165
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:08,802
I

166
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:08,935
would

167
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,369
never,

168
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:09,536
you

169
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:09,702
know,

170
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:09,903
mess

171
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,003
with

172
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:10,203
something

173
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:10,336
with a

174
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:10,637
frying

175
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,037
pan.

176
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:11,271
That was

177
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:11,638
scary

178
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,272
to me.

179
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:12,439
What

180
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:12,605
I do

181
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,774
with my beer.

182
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:15,041
If

183
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,341
the grill

184
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:15,575
gets a

185
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:15,708
little

186
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:15,842
bit

187
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:16,376
quiet,

188
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:16,609
I'll

189
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:16,876
check

190
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:16,976
it.

191
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:17,077
I'll

192
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:17,377
just

193
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:17,777
see if

194
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:18,011
it's

195
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:18,244
in a

196
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:18,711
good spot,

197
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:18,978
maybe

198
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:19,212
move a

199
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:19,379
little

200
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:19,479
bit,

201
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:19,712
grab

202
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:19,813
the

203
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:20,346
spatula,

204
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:20,613
move

205
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,181
it,

206
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,381
and

207
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:21,481
I'll

208
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:21,781
also

209
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,115
touch it

210
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:22,215
to

211
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:22,382
see

212
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,449
how

213
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:22,849
well

214
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,049
it's

215
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,383
cut.

216
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:23,616
Because

217
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:23,817
they

218
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:23,950
say

219
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,050
you

220
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,284
touch

221
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:24,417
your

222
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:24,717
hand.

223
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:24,884
Like

224
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:25,118
this

225
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:25,351
part

226
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,052
here

227
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:26,252
is

228
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,120
rare.

229
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,420
Back

230
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,021
here

231
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,254
is

232
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,022
medium

233
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:29,222
and

234
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:29,355
out

235
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:29,589
here

236
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:29,722
as

237
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:29,956
well.

238
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:30,957
Done.

239
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:31,357
There

240
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:31,991
it is.

241
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:32,692


242
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:32,926
You're

243
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,293
hiding

244
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:33,493
from

245
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,561
me.

246
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:34,761
All right,

247
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:34,861
well,

248
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,095
let's

249
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:35,261
take

250
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:35,395
out

251
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:35,762
our French

252
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,029
fries.

253
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:36,129
Why

254
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,262
don't

255
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:36,362
we

256
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:36,529
just

257
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:36,696
do

258
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,931
that?

259
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:38,498
Of

260
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:38,798
course.

261
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,132
Grab a

262
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:39,566
burger

263
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:39,732
that's

264
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,133
unplugged

265
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:40,233
the

266
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:40,500
George

267
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:40,800
Foreman

268
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,734
Grill

269
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,168
Safety

270
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:42,802
first.

271
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:42,969
Now,

272
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,103
it's

273
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:43,203
not

274
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:43,336
going

275
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:43,503
to be

276
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,636
too

277
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:44,003
terribly

278
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:44,204
hot

279
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:44,404
because

280
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:44,471
I'm

281
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:44,571
going

282
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:44,671
to

283
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:44,904
touch

284
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:44,971
some

285
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,138
sort

286
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:45,205
of

287
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:45,472
help.

288
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,572
And

289
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:45,738
there

290
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,639
we go.

291
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:46,773
And

292
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,240
that looks

293
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,507
and it

294
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:47,674
didn't

295
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:47,907
land

296
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:48,074
on the

297
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:48,475
rock

298
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:48,908
nowhere

299
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:49,909
near.

300
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,110
So

301
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,176
I

302
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:50,543
threw

303
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,044
that.

304
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:51,211
That's

305
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,511
pillow

306
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:51,878
ketchup

307
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:52,078
on

308
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:52,812
here

309
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,012
and

310
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:53,246
there

311
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:57,350
it is.

312
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,717
now

313
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:57,984
that's

314
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:58,318
what I

315
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,585
called

316
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:03,256
delicious.

317
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:03,790
So now

318
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:03,890
we're

319
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,090
just

320
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,224
going

321
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:04,290
to

322
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,524
wait

323
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:04,757
while

324
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,091
asleep

325
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:05,191
and

326
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:05,325
then

327
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:05,592
warms

328
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:05,859
up.

329
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,092
See,

330
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:06,292
so

331
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:06,459
far,

332
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:06,693
not

333
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:06,893
much.

334
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:06,960
So

335
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,093
let's

336
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:07,260
have a

337
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,161
look.

338
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,394
You could

339
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:08,628
probably

340
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:08,795
still

341
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,062
touch

342
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:09,429
it.

343
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:09,696
It's

344
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:09,963
not that

345
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,030
warm.

346
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,297
No,

347
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:11,598
I won't

348
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:11,731
do

349
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,098
that 2

350
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:12,332
minutes

351
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:12,432
from

352
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:12,732
now.
